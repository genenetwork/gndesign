* Introduction

Genenetwork was originally implemented as a web-based service in 1994
(one of the first in biology) as [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00356557][The Portable Dictionary of the Mouse
Genome]] and rebranded in 2001 as WebQTL and later again as Genenetwork
(GN). The great assets of GN are:

1. sophisticated web-based tools for anyone who can use a browser
2. immediate access to a large Mouse genetics database
3. explore and create new hypothesis using GN tools generating figures
   *ON THE FLY*.

Unlike most genetic web based tools GN allows for interactive
exploration of new and existing datasets over the web.

The architecture consists of an HTML/JS front-end and Python with
MySQL database backend.

Genenetwork1 is soon going to be replaced by a rewritten Web2.0
edition termed [[http://gn2.genenetwork.org/][Genenetwork2]].
