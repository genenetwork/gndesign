# Genenetwork Design/Architecture Documents

This repository contains the design and architecture documentation of
Genenetwork (a work in progress).

## Overview

GN allows for *interactive exploration* of new and existing genetics
datasets over the web.

Essentially Genenetwork is a web front-end written in Javascript with
a Python back-end on top of a MySQL database. Genenetwork2 is a
complete reimplementation of Genenetwork1 and will replace the latter
in the near future.

* Start exploring the Genenetwork1 docs [here](https://github.com/genenetwork/gndesign/blob/master/doc/GN1/gn1_overview.org).

## Notes

The documents are written in Emacs org mode which get displayed nicely
on github.
