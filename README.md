# Genenetwork Design/Architecture Documents

This repository contains the design and architecture documentation of
Genenetwork (a work in progress).

## Overview

GN allows for *interactive exploration* of new and existing genetics
datasets over the web.

GeneNetwork contains a coherent `universe' of data as well as many
powerful analytic tools

Essentially Genenetwork is a web front-end written in Javascript with
a Python back-end (which calls into R and C tools for computations) on
top of a MySQL database.

* Start exploring the Genenetwork1 [website](http://www.genenetwork.org/) and [docs](https://github.com/genenetwork/gndesign/blob/master/doc/GN1/gn1_overview.org).

Genenetwork2 is a complete reimplementation of Genenetwork1 and will
replace the latter in the near future.

* Start exploring the Genenetwork2
  [website](http://gn2.genenetwork.org/) and docs (not yet here).

## Notes

The documents are written in Emacs org mode which get displayed nicely
on github.
